  1.1.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Increase default request timeout lengths, the previous ones would often cause
        unnecessary timeouts.
      - On server reinstall, set SSH keys and images to their previous values, if
        they haven't been changed or are unprovided.
      - Wait for server to become active, if ``state`` is set to active, on server
        reinstall.
      - remove ddos_scrubbing option from the floating_ip module, since upstream API
        changes have made it unusable.
      - test - Properly delete floating IP after using it for server integration tests.
